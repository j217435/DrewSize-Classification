# DrillSize-Classification
This is sideproject  about drew size classification extract from video
## Introduction
This a personal sideproject to practice a extracted image classifcation from video.
Content included two machine learning method to finish this task. 
### ResNet
The ResNet was trained to do image classification. However, the performance wasn't good enough because of the computational resourses and the training time.
#### ResNet Result
